    <p>Hello! I am a student at University of California, San Diego and a Data Science major. 
        Aside from my academic life I enjoy fashion, makeup, reading, and sleeping. 
        I am currently reading Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugenides and am astounded by how much I enjoy it so far. 
        I also recently went to Disneyland for the first time in 10 years even though I am from Orange County. 
        The fall scent I am enjoying is September by Bjork and Berries.</p>
