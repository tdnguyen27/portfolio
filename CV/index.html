                <p>Dear Ms. Smith,</p>
                <p>I am applying for the Data Science Intern position at Nextdoor. 
                    In a world that has their eyes glued to the online, parasocial community Nextdoor 
                    uses the quintessential advantage of technology to assist individuals in turning 
                    to their local community, their next-door neighbors, and build the real-world 
                    connections many have been deficient of.
                </p>
                <p>My academic history has consisted of coding, data visualization, data exploration, 
                    statistical analysis, and machine learning algorithms
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Personal data exploration project</li>
                    <li>Pandas</li>
                    <li>Statistics</li>
                    <li>SQL</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Nextdoor strives to show that the neighborhood you come home to at the end of the day 
                    is the one that ultimately matters. This mission is something I am passionate about 
                    and would love to be part of a team that tackles the challenges faced in accomplishing this.
                </p>
                <p>Sincerely,<br>
                    Tori Nguyen
